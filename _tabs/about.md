Hi there,

I'm Tobi, a student at the University of Essex and I'm currently completing my Masters in Enterprise IT Management. 

During one of my modules, I was tasked to create an e-Portfolio, hence I created this site.

I work as a team lead, currently leading two different DevOps teams within a local Swiss bank.

I enjoy doing sport in my free time. I regularly go to the gym, go hiking in the mountains in summer and skiing in winter. I like travelling the world and I'm currently focusing on East Asia.
