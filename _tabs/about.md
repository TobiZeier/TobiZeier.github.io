Hi there,

I'm Tobi, a student at the University of Essex and I'm currently completing my Masters in Enterprise IT Management. 
During one of my modules, I was tasked to create an e-Portfolio, hence I created this site.
I work as a team lead, currently leading two different DevOps teams within a local Swiss bank.

If you'd like to find out more about my professional life, I invite you to take a look at my [CV](/assets/misc/TobiasZeierCVen.pdf).

I enjoy doing sport in my free time. I regularly go to the gym, go hiking in the mountains in summer and skiing in winter. I like travelling the world and I'm currently focusing on East Asia.

I’m best reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-zeier/). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
