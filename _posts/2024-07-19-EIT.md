## Assignment 1: Collaborative Learning Question
Our first assignment was to discuss the following statement: "The adoption of Enterprise IT is the single most significant change that can happen to any company/SME".

Please have a look at my initial post, my peer reviews as well as my summary post [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module1_Launching_into_Enterprise_IT_Management/Assignment1/Assignment1.pdf).


## Assignment 2: Individual Programming Exercise
For our second assignment, we were tasked to create a sort algorithm in Python to sort a large provided set of integers. In addition, we had to compare the performance of our own program with an algorithm written in C, which was provided by our tutor.

You can find my work [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/tree/main/Module1_Launching_into_Enterprise_IT_Management/Assignment2).

## Assignment 3: Individual Presentation
As a final assignment for this module, our task was to create a presentation where we had to identify ONE trend in EIT which will have the greatest impact over the next five years.

I invite you to take a look at my presentation [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/tree/main/Module1_Launching_into_Enterprise_IT_Management/Assignment3).
