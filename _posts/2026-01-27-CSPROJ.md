# 🎯 Module Overview

This module enabled me to:

- Develop a substantial individual computing project that demonstrates the ability to conduct independent inquiry and manage a complex research timeline effectively.
- Identify and apply appropriate research methodologies and data collection techniques to address a specific research question within the computing discipline.
- Critically appraise academic literature to establish a research space and justify the project's relevance through a structured proposal and ethical approval process.
- Demonstrate professional competencies in project management, risk assessment, and the communication of technical findings through a written dissertation and artefact presentation.

## Unit 1: An Introduction to Your Dissertation

**Key Concepts:**
- The dissertation as a continuation of Research Methods and Professional Practice
- Distinction between primary and secondary research
- John Swales' CARS Model (Create a Research Space)
- Developing research questions, aims and objectives
- Structure and importance of the research proposal

**Reflections:**
This unit introduced the dissertation as a significant piece of independent work that follows on from the previous Research Methods and Professional Practice module. We explored the differences between primary and secondary research to understand which approach suits our specific project needs. The reading introduced the concept of a research space as developed by John Swales which is essential for positioning our work within the wider academic discipline. We also focused on the practical elements of the dissertation such as reviewing the research topic and carving out a niche. The lecturecast provided guidance on formulating a clear research question along with specific aims and objectives. Understanding these key elements is critical for developing a robust research proposal.

## Unit 2: Project Planning and Risks

**Key Concepts:**
- Core concepts in project planning and management
- Agile methods versus plan driven approaches
- Deconstructing projects into manageable work packages
- Tracking progress using tools like Gantt charts
- Identifying and managing project risks

**Reflections:**
This week covered the essential methods for monitoring and managing the progress of the dissertation as an individual project. We compared different management approaches such as Agile methods and plan driven strategies to determine which is most appropriate for our work. A key learning point was the importance of subdividing the project into smaller and more logical components to make the workload manageable. We also examined methods for tracking progress including the use of Gantt charts. The unit concluded with a focus on risk management where we learned to identify potential risks and consider the necessary mitigation strategies.

## Unit 3: Project Types and Research Methods

**Key Concepts:**
- Overview of computing project types including software development and empirical analytical
- Differences between quantitative and qualitative methods
- Approaches to data collection and analysis
- Designing a research methodology to meet objectives
- Determining sample sizes for statistical power

**Reflections:**
This unit focused on the various project types and research methods available for a computing dissertation. We looked at the distinctions between quantitative and qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis. The lecturecast highlighted how to adopt a methodology that effectively meets the previously identified research objectives. We also explored technical aspects such as determining the appropriate sample size for statistical analysis. This knowledge is vital for defining a clear research design and preparing a practical data collection plan.

## Unit 4: Reviewing Literature

**Key Concepts:**
- Purpose and structure of a literature review
- Critical analysis and evaluation of academic sources
- Identifying gaps in current research
- Avoidance of self plagiarism from previous modules
- Conducting the first supervisory meeting

**Reflections:**
This unit provided the skills required to carry out and structure a comprehensive literature review. We investigated methods for critically evaluating sources to ensure they are reliable and relevant to our subject. A major focus was on using these critical analysis skills to identify a gap in the current research which justifies the proposed project. The unit also emphasised the academic offence of self plagiarism and the need to substantially revise any work used in previous modules. Additionally we were instructed to book and hold our first meeting with our allocated supervisor to discuss the proposal.

## Unit 5: Research Ethics

**Key Concepts:**
- Moral principles governing the conduct of researchers
- Developing accountable and trustworthy research
- Key ethical components including informed consent and confidentiality
- The right of participants to withdraw from the study
- The process for obtaining ethical approval

**Reflections:**
This unit focused on the importance of ethics when designing a computing project. I learned that research ethics are the moral principles that govern how a researcher carries out their work and that they are essential for ensuring the validity and appropriateness of the research. We discussed key components involved in ethical research such as informed consent and confidentiality as well as the right to withdraw. The unit highlighted the specific ethical expectations placed on us during the project and the necessity of engaging with the approval process. It was noted that the ethical approval application is due at the end of Unit 8. We were also instructed to provide a revised research proposal for our supervisors to review so that any amendments can be incorporated into the ethical approval application.

**Related Work:**
- 📄 Understanding Ethical Considerations

## Unit 6: Intellectual Property
<!-- 
**Key Concepts:**
- Definition and identification of intellectual property (IP)
- Methods for protecting IP such as copyrights and patents
- Relevance of IP laws to computer science and technology
- Avoiding violations of IP legislation
- Evolution of IP law in response to modern technology

**Reflections:**
This unit explored the concept of intellectual property and its significance within the computing field. We discussed what constitutes IP and examined the various methods available for protecting it. The reading provided high profile examples demonstrating how rapidly IP law must evolve to keep pace with technological advancements. The unit emphasised the importance of being aware of IP legislation to avoid violations and to protect our own work. A major focus of this week was the compulsory submission of the revised Research Proposal and Ethical Approval application. This submission required a summary of changes from the original proposal, a detailed project plan including aims and objectives, a literature review skeleton, and a breakdown of work packages. We were reminded that starting research without ethical approval is a serious academic offence.

## Units 7-30: Dissertation
<!--
**Key Concepts:**
- Execution of the research project and dissertation writing
- Regular supervisory meetings including a compulsory session in Week 9
- Preparation for the artefact presentation at the online conference
- Double marking process involving two independent markers
- Potential for publishing research with the supervisor as co author

**Reflections:**
These units represented the core execution phase of the module where the focus shifted entirely to conducting the research and writing the dissertation. I continued to work towards the final submission due at the end of Unit 28 while preparing my artefact presentation for the online conference in Units 29 and 30. Regular meetings with my supervisor were essential for guidance especially the compulsory session in Week 9. I learned about the rigorous marking process which involves double marking over a three week period to ensure fairness and accuracy. The unit also highlighted the possibility of publishing the research. I understood that any publication requires co authorship with my supervisor to acknowledge their contribution and that I must carefully consider journal requirements fees and open access options.
