## Unit 1: Introduction to Enterprise IT Project Management

> 💬 *"Understanding the pitfalls of past IT project failures is the first step towards future success."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Core concepts and definitions of IT project management.
- Common causes of major IT project failures: poor planning, inadequate risk management, misaligned stakeholder expectations.
- Importance of mitigating risks in future projects.
- Different project methods, their advantages and disadvantages.

**Reflections:**
This unit provided a solid foundation in IT project management. By analysing documented IT project failures, I learned to identify common causes such as poor planning and inadequate risk management, highlighting the importance of understanding these pitfalls for effective risk mitigation in future projects. I also explored various project methods and their respective advantages and disadvantages. My initial forum post contributed to this understanding.

## Unit 2: Requirements Gathering, Management and Analysis Techniques

> 💬 *"Clear and precise requirements are the bedrock of successful software development."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Critical importance of requirements gathering, management, and analysis in project initiation.
- Foundational role of this phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- Techniques for effective requirements gathering: interviews, workshops, prototyping.
- Use of the Cucumber framework and Gherkin syntax for clear, testable scenarios.

**Reflections:**
This unit emphasised the foundational role of accurate requirements management in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I explored various techniques for gathering and managing requirements and found the Cucumber framework, with its Gherkin syntax, particularly insightful for bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders. My initial attempt with Gherkin statements is a practical demonstration of this learning.

## Unit 3: Project Management Tasks and Techniques

> 💬 *"Effective project managers combine clear responsibilities with robust tools to drive success."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Day-to-day responsibilities of a project manager (PM).
- Essential tools and techniques for effective project management.
- Understanding and application of the RACI chart for clarifying roles and responsibilities.
- Use of Gantt charts and risk registers in planning, tracking, and problem-solving.

**Reflections:**
This unit provided a detailed understanding of the project manager's role, particularly focusing on the application of the RACI chart for clarity in team responsibilities and the use of tools like Gantt charts for planning and tracking. Finalising our group project for submission was a key highlight, allowing us to apply these techniques in a practical setting. My summary post to the discussion forum reflects on these learnings.

## Unit 4: Project Management and Risk

> 💬 *"Proactive risk management is indispensable for safeguarding project success in the face of uncertainty."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Crucial role of risk management in project success.
- Review of the Risk Management Process (RMP): identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks.
- Impact of risks on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- Various risk mitigation strategies: thorough planning, rigorous testing, accurate estimating.

**Reflections:**
This unit provided a deeper understanding of risk management within project contexts, particularly its integration into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I explored the Risk Management Process (RMP) and various mitigation strategies, reinforcing the importance of proactive measures to minimise uncertainties and ensure project success.

## Unit 5: Future Trends in IT Project Management

> 💬 *"Adapting to automation, AI, and remote work is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of IT project management."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Future trends shaping IT Project Management (ITPM): automation, AI, and remote work.
- Transformation of project delivery due to these trends.
- Challenges posed by disruptions: changing roles and faster project demands.
- Mitigation techniques: agile methodologies and improved planning.

**Reflections:**
This unit offered valuable insights into the future trends of IT Project Management, focusing on how automation, AI, and remote work are transforming project delivery. I examined the challenges these disruptions bring and explored mitigation techniques such as agile methodologies, which is crucial for navigating the modern ITPM landscape and preparing for future changes.

## Unit 6: Debate: What is the Most Influential IT Trend That Will Affect IT Project Management in the Next Five Years?

> 💬 *"Engaging in critical debate illuminates the multifaceted impacts of emerging technologies on IT project management."*

**Key Concepts:**
- Disruptive trends impacting IT Project Management in the next five years: AI and automation.
- Review and discussion of various trends and their pros and cons.
- Processing and recommendation based on updated project data.

**Reflections:**
The final unit culminated in a debate on the most influential IT trends affecting IT Project Management, specifically focusing on AI and automation. A significant highlight was the final assignment, where I processed updated project data and provided client recommendations, which was a practical application of our learning throughout the module. Our group's slides and my final work demonstrate the application of these skills.
