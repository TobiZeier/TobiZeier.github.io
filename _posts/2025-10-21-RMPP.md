# 🎯 Module Overview

This module enabled me to:

- Acquire the ability to study and reflect on key principles and methods in research based on the scientific method, applicable across multiple disciplines.  
- Examine various research strategies and designs suitable for different project contexts.  
- Develop research competencies, particularly in collecting and analysing diverse data types to design, conduct, and evaluate independent research critically.  
- Take a reflective and independent approach to the learning process, enhancing professional and academic growth.

## Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

**Key Concepts:**

- The purpose and objectives of research (exploration, description, explanation)  
- The scientific method: observation, hypothesis, reasoning, testing  
- Deductive and inductive reasoning  
- Ethics and professionalism in research  
- The Menlo Report principles and BCS Code of Conduct

**Reflections:**

This unit introduced the foundations of research methods and their importance in computing. I learned that research serves three main purposes, to explore, to describe, and to explain (QuestionPro, 2021). The scientific method, which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning, and testing, remains the cornerstone of credible investigation (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020).  

Through practical examples, I developed a clearer understanding of **deductive** and **inductive** reasoning. Deduction moves from theory to observation, whereas induction starts from observation and builds toward theory. Recognising when to apply each approach enhances both logical problem-solving and analytical thinking.  

Ethics emerged as a vital theme in this unit. The Menlo Report outlines four principles — Respect, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest — that guide ethical research (Finn and Shilton, 2023). These principles are directly relevant to computing, especially in the age of artificial intelligence and data-driven systems, where privacy, consent, and accountability are key (Deckard, 2023). Understanding and applying ethical frameworks, including the BCS Code of Conduct, ensures professionalism and integrity in research practice.  

This unit laid the groundwork for ethical and methodical research design. It has reinforced my appreciation of the balance between innovation, responsibility, and professional accountability in the computing field.
