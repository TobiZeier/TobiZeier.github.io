## Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing

**Key Concepts:**
- The purpose and objectives of research (exploration, description, explanation)  
- The scientific method: observation, hypothesis, reasoning, testing  
- Deductive and inductive reasoning  
- Ethics and professionalism in research  
- The Menlo Report principles and BCS Code of Conduct

**Reflections:**
This unit introduced the foundations of research methods and their importance in computing. I learned that research serves three main purposes, to explore, to describe, and to explain (QuestionPro, 2021). The scientific method, which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning, and testing, remains the cornerstone of credible investigation (Anderson and Hepburn, 2020).  

Through practical examples, I developed a clearer understanding of deductive and inductive reasoning. Deduction moves from theory to observation, whereas induction starts from observation and builds toward theory. Recognising when to apply each approach enhances both logical problem-solving and analytical thinking.  

Ethics emerged as a vital theme in this unit. The Menlo Report outlines four principles — Respect, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest — that guide ethical research (Finn and Shilton, 2023). These principles are directly relevant to computing, especially in the age of artificial intelligence and data-driven systems, where privacy, consent, and accountability are key (Deckard, 2023). Understanding and applying ethical frameworks, including the BCS Code of Conduct, ensures professionalism and integrity in research practice.  

This unit laid the groundwork for ethical and methodical research design. It has reinforced my appreciation of the balance between innovation, responsibility, and professional accountability in the computing field.

## Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal

**Key Concepts:**
- Formulating and refining research questions  
- Developing a research proposal  
- Understanding and conducting a literature review  
- Evaluating existing research to identify gaps and opportunities  

**Reflections:**
This week’s unit focused on developing effective research questions and understanding how these form the foundation of a strong research proposal. I learned that defining a research topic can be a challenging and iterative process, often requiring multiple revisions to achieve clarity and focus (Golash-Boza, 2011). However, this stage is crucial for ensuring that the research remains purposeful and achievable.

A key takeaway was that a well-crafted research question drives every aspect of a project, from methodology to analysis, by narrowing the scope of investigation and providing a clear direction. The unit also introduced the structure and purpose of a research proposal, which acts as both a planning document and a rationale for why the research should be undertaken.

Another important element discussed was the literature review. This process involves surveying academic sources to identify existing theories, frameworks, and knowledge gaps within a chosen area of study. Conducting a literature review not only strengthens one’s understanding of the topic but also helps position new research within the broader academic conversation. I found that it also supports critical thinking, as it encourages comparing and evaluating diverse viewpoints rather than merely summarising them.

Overall, this unit provided me with the essential tools to conceptualise a research topic, transform ideas into well-defined questions, and justify a study through structured academic review. These skills are fundamental to producing a high-quality postgraduate research project.

## Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods

**Key Concepts:**
- Research design and philosophical assumptions (ontology, epistemology, axiology)​
- Exploratory vs. descriptive research designs​
- Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research​
- Primary and secondary data collection​
- Data collection tools: surveys, interviews, case studies, observations​

**Reflections:**
This unit emphasized that methodology choices reflect underlying philosophical assumptions about reality, knowledge, and values. Understanding the difference between exploratory and descriptive research designs clarified when each approach is appropriate based on problem definition. Learning about qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods revealed how inductive and deductive approaches serve different research purposes. Qualitative for exploring "how" and "why," quantitative for answering "how many" and "to what extent".

## Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

**Key Concepts:**
- Case studies: in-depth research for hypothesis generation, limited generalizability​
- Focus groups: 6-10 participants with common backgrounds exploring "why," "what," and "how"​
- Quantitative observation: collecting numerical data through structured methods​
- Qualitative observation: monitoring natural behaviors and characteristics​
- Multiple methods can be combined for comprehensive data collection

**Reflections:**
This unit explored data collection methods used primarily for qualitative research but applicable to quantitative approaches. Case studies provide deep insights but have limitations in establishing causality and generalisability due to potential bias. Focus groups reveal group dynamics that individual methods cannot capture, requiring careful participant selection with common backgrounds. Understanding the distinction between quantitative observation (numerical, structured) and qualitative observation (contextual, natural) clarified how observation serves different research purposes. The flexibility to combine multiple methods reinforces the importance of selecting appropriate tools based on research questions.
