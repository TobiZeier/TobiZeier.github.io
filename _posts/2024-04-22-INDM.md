## The Use of an e-Portfolio

> üí¨ *"ePortfolios can be used as a powerful marketing tool to display evidence of needed knowledge and skills for employment (Lu, 2021)."*

**Key Concepts:**
- E-portfolios as an augmentation to CVs
- Demonstration of practical work and skills
- Utility for both technical and managerial roles

**Reflections:**
In my capacity as head of two DevOps teams, I frequently review e-portfolios during recruitment, perceiving them as a valuable adjunct to a candidate's CV, showcasing practical work and a breadth of experience. Previously, I considered e-portfolios primarily beneficial for engineers to exhibit coding projects and passion; however, this module broadened my perspective. I now recognise their equal utility for managers to present accumulated skills, experiences, and project leadership. I am keen to embark on creating my own e-portfolio on GitHub, anticipating a steep, yet rewarding, learning curve given my limited prior experience with both e-portfolios and GitHub.
