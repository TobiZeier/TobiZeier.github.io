## Unit 7: Hypothesis Testing and Summary Measures Worksheet

These exercises introduce key statistical summary measures in Excel, such as the mean, standard deviation, median, and quartiles, using real dietary data. You will analyse weight loss for two diets and interpret which appears more effective based on these statistics.

### 7.1.1B - Descriptive Statistics and Data Exploration

_Figure 1: Exercise 7.1.1B (University of Essex Online, 2025)_

**Key Findings**
- Measured on the Mean and Standard Diviation, the data implies that Diet B is less effective.


### 7.1.2B - Frequency Distributions

_Figure 2: Exercise 7.1.2B (University of Essex Online, 2025)_

**Key Findings**
- The Median confirms the Mean.
- Diet A has a slight left skew.
- For Diet B, the Mean almost identical to the Median.
- Dieat A has a Q1 of 3.7 while Diet B has a Mean of 3.7. This means 75% of paticipians from Diet A scored higher than the average person from Diet B.


### 7.1.3B - Comparative Analysis of Distributions

**Key Findings**
- Both Areas have Other as the preferred cereal brand.
- Area 1 has Other as most chosen brand.
- Area 2 has more active or diverse distribution of Cereal A and B compared to Area 1.


### 7.2.2 - Filtration Agent Comparison (Paired t-Test)
![Exercise7.2.2](/assets/img/posts/RMPPE/7.2.2.jpeg)
_Figure 4: Exercise 7.2.2 (University of Essex Online, 2025)_

**Key Findings**
- We are testing if Agent 1 is more effective (lower impurity).
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\mu_1 \ge \mu_2$ (Agent 1 is not more effective; the mean difference is zero or positive).
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\mu_1 < \mu_2$ (Agent 1 is more effective; impurity levels are strictly lower).
- Mean Difference: $-0.43$ (Agent 1 is lower on average)
- One-tailed p-value: $0.0038$
- The one-tailed p-value ($0.0038$) is significantly lower than the standard alpha level of $0.05$. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Filter Agent 2 at removing impurities.


### 7.2.3

_Figure 5: Exercise 7.2.3 (University of Essex Online, 2025)_

**Key Findings**
***Check: Homogeneity of Variance**
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\sigma^2_{male} = \sigma^2_{female}$ (The variances are equal).
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\sigma^2_{male} \neq \sigma^2_{female}$ (The variances are different).
- F-Statistic: $1.23$
- P-value: $0.436$
- Since the p-value ($0.436$) is greater than the significance level ($\alpha = 0.05$), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Hence we can proceede with the t-Test.

**t-Test**
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\mu_{male} \le \mu_{female}$ (Male income is not significantly greater than female income).
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\mu_{male} > \mu_{female}$ (Male income is significantly greater than female income).
- The analysis shows that the mean income for males (£52,910) is higher than for females (£44,230). The difference of £8,680 is statistically significant ($t = 3.27$, $p < .001$).
- Verdict: We reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence to conclude that the population mean income for male cardholders exceeds that of female cardholders.
