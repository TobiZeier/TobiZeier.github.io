# Research Methods and Professional Practice - Professional Skills Matrix, SWOT & Development Plan

This section provides a structured overview of the professional competencies I have developed throughout my MSc Enterprise IT Management programme, alongside a SWOT analysis and planned actions arising from these learnings. It serves as the capstone of my learning journey, bringing together insights and skills acquired across all modules, including research methodologies, enterprise IT, project management, data science, security and risk management and more. This comprehensive synthesis underpins the reflective narrative presented in the final 1000 word [reflection](#swot-analysis).
