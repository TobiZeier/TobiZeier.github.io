## Unit 1: Data Science - Overview
This week, we explored the foundational concepts of data science, including data architecture, pipelines, big data, and analytics tools. We learned how structured data systems support efficient data flow and analysis within organisations. The importance of business intelligence was highlighted, showing how data-driven insights inform strategic decision-making. We also studied the convergence of technologies like AI, IoT, Cloud, and Blockchain, all centred around a data-centric approach. Through the cybersecurity paper, we saw how machine learning and anomaly detection are used to combat modern digital threats. Overall, the week provided a strong introduction to how data science underpins both business operations and digital security. Furthermore I submitted a post on our forum, where we discussed our views on the paradigm shift towards the convergence of data science, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity. You can find my post [here]().
