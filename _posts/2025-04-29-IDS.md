## Unit 4: Big Data Architecture

**Key Concepts:**
- Data Lakes vs Warehouses
- 4Vs: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity
- Cloud integration and data mining

**Reflections:**
Exploring big data architecture revealed the scalability and complexity of large-scale systems, and how data lakes and warehouses are designed to handle the 4Vs. The discussion around security concerns in cloud-based storage, such as data residency and access control for sensitive information, was particularly insightful, highlighting the need for robust governance in such environments and the critical importance of safeguards.

## Unit 5: Analytics Tools

**Key Concepts:**
- Data analytics in enterprise strategy
- Tool selection and contextual use
- Relationship between analytics and EDA

**Reflections:**
I explored tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Python-based analytics, building a clearer understanding of how analytical tools are used in different organisational scenarios. The link between analytics and enterprise architecture stood out, emphasising how crucial it is to choose the right tool for the right situation to impact decision-making across the business. The HBR article analysis offered practical insights into financial sector transformations.

## Unit 6: Value of Data

**Key Concepts:**
- Data valuation models
- Direct vs indirect costs
- Enterprise data classification

**Reflections:**
I learned to assess data’s financial value and propose strategies for extracting its business worth, distinguishing between direct and indirect costs of data and how they affect decision-making. The second assignment allowed me to apply EDA principles to real data by recommending an Enterprise Data Architecture for the Department of Traffic in London, highlighting the practical application of these concepts.

## Unit 7: IP Strategy

**Key Concepts:**
- Data as Intellectual Property
- IP protection in digital ecosystems
- EDA as a strategic enabler

**Reflections:**
I now appreciate how data assets can be protected and strategically managed to maintain competitive advantage, learning that data is a valuable asset within an Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA). This unit equipped me with an understanding of deploying EDA as a strategic tool for digital transformation, including safeguarding data assets and identifying complements that drive EDA.
