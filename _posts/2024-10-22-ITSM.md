## Unit 1: Introduction to Information Technology Service Management (ITSM)
In this Unit we had our first seminar where we got to know our new tutor. We have learned about the basic concepts of ITSM such as:
 * Service Catalog
 * Service Level Management
 * Incident Management
 * Problem Management
 * Change Management
 * Asset Management
and more. We were tasked to submit a post to the discussion forum, where the question was: “How does understanding the definition, importance, and key concepts of IT Service Management (ITSM) contribute to effective service delivery and organisational success?” You can find my post [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module3_Information_Technology_Service_Management/Unit1-ForumPost.pdf).


## Unit 2: Information Technology Service Management Principles and Processes
This week there was a lecturecast to complete. It elaborated further on the fundamental principles of ITSM. As a formative activity, we were tasked to read in our core ebook, “Delivering ITSM for Business Maturity: A Practical Framework” written by Beverly Weed-Schertzer (2019) as well as two papers regarding incident management and the effectiveness of IT service management capability. This laid the basis to complete the case study where we were confronted with a delicate situation in a fictional company. iTech Corporation, a leading provider of IT Services, faces challenges egarding the efficiency and effectiveness of incident management processes, leading to increased resolution times and customer dissatisfaction. You can find my reflective journal post, where I solved the case study, [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module3_Information_Technology_Service_Management/Unit2-ReflectiveJournal.pdf).
