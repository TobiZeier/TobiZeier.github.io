## Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management
What is a risk? In this first session for our new module, our class was introduced to new students from the cybersecurity course, where we learned that there are different definitions for the term risk. Douglas Hubbard (2020) says risk is: "A potential loss, disaster, or other undesirable event measured with probabilities assigned to losses of various magnitudes." Furthermore, we were informed about our first assignment, which will be a group task, where we will be doing a risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar business which is thinking about an online presence. On top of that I conducted the formative assignment, a [collaborative discussion](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) about risk assessment frameworks in relation to Industry 4.0.

 
## Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process
This week I started to setup my ePortfolio, which will be reviewed and graded by the end of the module. It is my first-time using GitHub, hence it takes some time for me, but I eventually figure it out. Since our first assignment will be a group task, we were all assigned to a group. As a start, I setup a team meeting to discuss and fill out our group contract, which we will send to our tutor. I was assigned the meeting manager role, which includes setting up reoccurring team meetings. We all agree to kick off this assignment by answering questions from the case study. I also continued with the collaborative discussion, where I submitted [two feedbacks](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) to posts from my fellow students. The question arises if traditional risk assessment frameworks are still valid in a digital world.
 
 
## Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management
In week 3 I have learned basic concepts of different threat modelling frameworks such as STRIDE & DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA and OWASP. In our group assignment I laid hands on my first actual risk assessment. I was tasked to do a risk assessment for the brick-and-mortar store, which focused on inventory management, as well as supply chain management. Apart from that I wrote my [summary post](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) for the collaborative learning discussion where I referenced to Bone and Lee (2023) who argue that traditional risk management approaches are outdated and inadequate for the new challenges presented by the digital era. Therefore, they introduced a "Cognitive Risk Framework" that integrates the human element into risk management strategies, emphasising the importance of understanding and addressing human behaviour and cognitive biases as critical factors in mitigating risks.


## Unit 4: Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques
As a preparation for this week's seminar, we were tasked to read about different threat modelling frameworks and take them into practice with different examples which you can find [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/tree/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/AttackTree). We were asked to use the Threat modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat modelling Cookbook and the ATT&CK libraries as a basis. Furthermore, we held our weekly group meeting to catch up on each others tasks as well as assigning new tasks for the upcoming week.


## Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise
General data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe’s data and privacy and security law, was the main topic for this unit. According to [gdpr.eu](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) it is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. There are the following seven principles for the lawful processing of personal data

1. **Lawfulness, fairness and transparency** — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
2. **Purpose limitation** — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.
3. **Data minimization** — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.
4. **Accuracy** — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.
5. **Storage limitation** — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.
6. **Integrity and confidentiality** — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).
7. **Accountability** — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.

As a formative activity, we had to choose a case study in relation with mishandling of personal data and answer questions about it. You can find my case study [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit5-CaseStudy.pdf).

On top of that, we were also tasked to create a Wiki post to our learning plattform, which discusses various IT security frameworks and their applicability to different industries. You can find my post [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit5-WikiPost.pdf).

As for the group assignment, we had our weekly group call, where we assigned new tasks to each member which will be due by next Monday. We are slowly reaching a point, where all tasks are done, all questions are answered but now we need merge them together into one file.


## Unit 6: The Practical Implications of Security and Risk Standards
As we approach the deadline of our group assignment, in which we were tasked to do a risk assessment and threat modeling for a brick and morter business, including recommendation for a possible adoption to an e-commerce strategy, this weeks focus was mainly about completing our assignment and filling out the peer reviews, where we had to grade our fellow group members. You can find all content which our group has developed [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/tree/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/GroupAssignment).

Furthermore, there was an activity to carry out, which was discussed in our weekly seminar. It was about security standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS and HIPAA in relation to the business that we worked on in our group assignment. Security standards are needed for several reasons, including the prevention from misusing customer data, uniformity (all organisations follow the same rules), protection against threats, and more. You can find my activity [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit6-SecurityStandards.pdf).


## Unit 7: An Introduction to the Concepts of Quantitative Risk Modelling
Rigaud et al. (2024) say: "The overall aim of quantitative risk assessment as broadly defined can be described as the quantification of the population impact of any type of factor, exposure, policy or program, hypothesized or already present."
To get a deeper understanding of quantitative risk models, we were tasked to put our hands on two well known models, Monte Carlo Simulation and Bayes theorem. You can find my spreadsheet with the Monte Carlo Simulation [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit7-montecarlo.xlsx) and my exercises with Bayes theorem, written in Python [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit7-probability.py) and [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit7-bayes.py).
There was also another collaborative learning discussion in which we had to read a paper, written by Spring et al. (2021) and answer the following two questions:
1. **What characteristics of CVSS do the authors criticise? Do you agree with the critique? Justify your answer with academic references.**
2. **The authors also discuss a number of alternatives to CVSS. Select one of these alternatives and post an argument for why it should replace CVSS.**
Please find my post which I have made to the students forum [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/temp.txt).


## Unit 8: Implementing Quantitative Risk Models
In this Unit we looked at how to implement quantitative risk models to real world problems. However, since we received our grades for the group project earlier this week, this weeks seminar was mainly about discussing the feedback we got as well as the grading system for such projects. There was also an ad-hoc voting where students were asked whether they prefere individual or collective grades for group project. I was not surprised, that all of the present students voted for individual grades.
As usual, we continued with our collaborative learning discussion where I submitted two peer responses to my fellow students. You can find my responses [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/temp.txt).
