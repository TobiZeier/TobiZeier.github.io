## Content of this module

* Discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.
* Describe how to carry out both kinds of assessments.
* Explain what is meant by and how to create threat models.
* Demonstrate how to create quantitative risk models.
* Discuss and design DR solutions.


## Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management
What is a risk? In this first session for our new module, our class was introduced to new students from the cybersecurity course, where we learned that there are different definitions for the term risk. Douglas Hubbard (2020) says risk is: "A potential loss, disaster, or other undesirable event measured with probabilities assigned to losses of various magnitudes." Furthermore, we were informed about our first assignment, which will be a group task, where we will be doing a risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar business which is thinking about an online presence. On top of that I conducted the formative assignment, a [collaborative discussion](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) about risk assessment frameworks in relation to Industry 4.0.

 
## Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process
This week I started to setup my ePortfolio, which will be reviewed and graded by the end of the module. It is my first-time using GitHub, hence it takes some time for me, but I eventually figure it out. Since our first assignment will be a group task, we were all assigned to a group. As a start, I setup a team meeting to discuss and fill out our group contract, which we will send to our tutor. I was assigned the meeting manager role, which includes setting up reoccurring team meetings. We all agree to kick off this assignment by answering questions from the case study. I also continued with the collaborative discussion, where I submitted [two feedbacks](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) to posts from my fellow students. The question arises if traditional risk assessment frameworks are still valid in a digital world.
 
 
## Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management
In week 3 I have learned basic concepts of different threat modelling frameworks such as STRIDE & DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA and OWASP. In our group assignment I laid hands on my first actual risk assessment. I was tasked to do a risk assessment for the brick-and-mortar store, which focused on inventory management, as well as supply chain management. Apart from that I wrote my [summary post](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Collaborative%20Learning%20Discussion.pdf) for the collaborative learning discussion where I referenced to Bone and Lee (2023) who argue that traditional risk management approaches are outdated and inadequate for the new challenges presented by the digital era. Therefore, they introduced a "Cognitive Risk Framework" that integrates the human element into risk management strategies, emphasising the importance of understanding and addressing human behaviour and cognitive biases as critical factors in mitigating risks.


## Unit 4: Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques
As a preparation for this week's seminar, we were tasked to read about different threat modelling frameworks and take them into practice with different examples which you can find [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/tree/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/AttackTree). We were asked to use the Threat modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat modelling Cookbook and the ATT&CK libraries as a basis. Furthermore, we held our weekly group meeting to catch up on each others tasks as well as assigning new tasks for the upcoming week.

## Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise
General data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe’s data and privacy and security law, was the main topic for this unit. According to [gdpr.eu](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) it is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. There are the following seven principles for the lawful processing of personal data

1. **Lawfulness, fairness and transparency** — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
2. **Purpose limitation** — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.
3. **Data minimization** — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.
4. **Accuracy** — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.
5. **Storage limitation** — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.
6. **Integrity and confidentiality** — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).
7. **Accountability** — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.

As a formative activity, we had to choose a case study in relation with mishandling of personal data and answer questions about it. You can find my case study [here](https://github.com/TobiZeier/UoEO_MSc_EIM/blob/main/Module2_Security_and_Risk_Management/Unit5-CaseStudy.pdf).

As for the group assignment, we had our weekly group call, where we assigned new tasks to each member which will be due by next Monday. We are slowly reaching a point, where all tasks are done, all questions are answered but now we need merge them together into one file.
