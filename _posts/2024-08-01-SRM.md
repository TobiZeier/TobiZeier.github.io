* Describe how to carry out both kinds of assessments.
* Explain what is meant by and how to create threat models.
* Demonstrate how to create quantitative risk models.
* Discuss and design DR solutions.


## Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management
What is a risk? In this first session for our new module, our class was introduced to new students from the cybersecurity course, where we learned that there are different definitions for the term risk. Douglas Hubbard (2020) says risk is: "A potential loss, disaster, or other undesirable event measured with probabilities assigned to losses of various magnitudes." Furthermore, we were informed about our first assignment, which will be a group task, where we will be doing a risk assessment for a brick-and-mortar business which is thinking about an online presence. On top of that I conducted the formative assignment, a collaborative discussion about risk assessment frameworks in relation to Industry 4.0.

 
## Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process
This week I started to setup my ePortfolio, which will be reviewed and graded by the end of the module. It is my first-time using GitHub, hence it takes some time for me, but I eventually figure it out. Since our first assignment will be a group task, we were all assigned to a group. As a start, I setup a team meeting to discuss and fill out our group contract, which we will send to our tutor. I was assigned the meeting manager role, which includes setting up reoccurring team meetings. We all agree to kick off this assignment by answering questions from the case study. I also continued with the collaborative discussion, where I submitted two feedbacks to posts from my fellow students. The question arises if traditional risk assessment frameworks are still valid in a digital world.
 
 
## Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management
In week 3 I have learned basic concepts of different threat modelling frameworks such as STRIDE & DREAD, CVSS, Attack Trees, PASTA and OWASP. In our group assignment I laid hands on my first actual risk assessment. I was tasked to do a risk assessment for the brick-and-mortar store, which focused on inventory management, as well as supply chain management. Apart from that I wrote my summary post for the collaborative learning discussion where I referenced to Bone and Lee (2023) who argue that traditional risk management approaches are outdated and inadequate for the new challenges presented by the digital era. Therefore, they introduced a "Cognitive Risk Framework" that integrates the human element into risk management strategies, emphasising the importance of understanding and addressing human behavior and cognitive biases as critical factors in mitigating risks.
